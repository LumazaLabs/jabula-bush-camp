JABULA BUSH CAMP STORY:
More than 20 years ago Francois had the opportunity to build wooden decks and hideouts in the Timbivati/ Umbubat Game Reserve, part of the bigger Kruger National Park, at one of the beautiful private farms and that is where the dream started,
Francois always said that one day his family will have their own little piece of Joy in Africa,” Jabula”!
In 2018 Francois & his son in law Nicky decided to partner and started looking for the perfect property. After many properties viewed and a lot of kilometres driven, Francois & Lucia found this beautiful piece of rustic bushveld in Dinokeng and knew that this was the one. When they showed it to the family, there was a herd of Elephants on the property enjoying their Sunday afternoon grazing amongst the trees, the confirmation that this is a place of JOY and Happiness.
Jabula Bush Camp was registered 10 October 2019.
Jabula’s success has been the involvement and hard work, sweat and tears of the whole family and extended family. Most of the work of the exterior and interior of the tents was hand made by the owners & family, with our Guests comfort in mind and that is what Jabula has sort after once in a lifetime experience for each guest visiting us.
The 4 Glamping Tents; are well equipped, totally off the grid with solar power so no load shedding. Comfortable beds and basic amenities such as lighting and charging points for cell phones.
Each tent has its own private splash pool.

The Communal Facility; There is a communal facility which includes; a Big 24+ Seat Dining area, Kitchen, Bathroom, Braai area and Outdoor Boma. When 3-4 Tents are booked by one group, the communal area becomes mandatory, because the Tents only caters for 6 guests and cannot handle a group of 20+.

The 5 Fenceless Private Bush Camps; Each have its own private Ablution, outdoor shower, and washup area, is big enough for 2 Caravans and 2 Tents, 8 Guests per stand allowed.

Jabula Bush Camp is a great option for accommodation in Dinokeng. The camp offers a rustic and authentic bush experience, with comfortable tents and communal facilities. The staff at Jabula are friendly and knowledgeable about the reserve and can arrange game drives and other activities for guests.

Our wish for each guest is that Jabula Bush Camp leaves a footprint of Joy & Happiness in each person’s memory that visits this special piece of Africa.
